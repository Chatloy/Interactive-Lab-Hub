# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview
For this assignment, you are going to:

A) [Plan](#part-a-plan) 

B) [Act out the interaction](#part-b-act-out-the-interaction) 

C) [Prototype the device](#part-c-prototype-the-device)

D) [Wizard the device](#part-d-wizard-the-device) 

E) [Costume the device](#part-e-costume-the-device)

F) [Record the interaction](#part-f-record)

Labs are due on Mondays. Make sure this page is linked to on your main class hub page.

## Part A. Plan 

_Setting:_ Handwashing is critially important for staying self hygiene. Though the awareness is high among most people(considering the COVID-19 pendemic), there are still some cases that people wash their hands in an incorrect way, or simply wet their hands for 2 seconds and it's all done.

_Players:_ ANYONE who is using the restroom in public/private places.

_Activity:_ When the tap is on, the people using it will be guided on how long they should go under water and what processes should be gone through.

_Goals:_ The interactive device is a simple board attached to the tap, or places just in front of the basin(e.g. on the bottom of the mirror). When the tap is on, the timing starts and the color goes yellow - orange - red - violet - indigo - blue - green. Each transition takes about 3 seconds, and goes correspondingly with the handwashing steps advised by CDC, in a total of ~20 seconds.

A simple sketch is here:

_Feedback:_ 


## Part B. Act out the Interaction

When I was acting out the interaction, I found some reflection and inspiration:

a) Pictures can be added to illustrate the 6 steps of handwashing, going alone with the lights;

b) Considering that people in a rush are likely to stop washing after wetting their hands for several seconds, we can show 'DON'T STOP' in the orange/red stage. This color is the best for caution, warning and indicating that a super short time of wash is never correct.


## Part C. Prototype the device

I use my smartphone as a stand-in for the device I'm prototyping. I will use is as a “light”, a signal and a board showing instructions on handwashing steps.


## Part D. Wizard the device
//Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

My first attempt is about tring to figure out where to put the 'light':

And the follow-up goes:

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop a costume so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your device might look like here.**\*\*

\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*


## Part F. Record

The final prototyped interaction is here:

\*\***Please indicate anyone you collaborated with on this Lab.**\*\*
Be generous in acknowledging their contributions! And also recognizing any other influences (e.g. from YouTube, Github, Twitter) that informed your design. 


# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
